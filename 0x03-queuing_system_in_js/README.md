# Node.js and Redis Integration Project

## Overview

This project focuses on integrating Redis with a Node.js application, utilizing Redis as both a cache and a message broker with the help of the deprecated but industry-used Kue library. Throughout this project, participants will learn how to set up a Redis server locally, perform basic operations using the Redis client in Node.js, handle asynchronous operations, and implement Kue for queue management. The final objective is to build a basic Express application that interacts with the Redis server and employs a queue system.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04
- **Node.js**: Version 12.x
- **Redis**: Version 5.0.7

Ensure all development and runtime environments meet these specifications for compatibility purposes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Set up and run a local Redis server.
- Execute simple commands using the Redis client.
- Utilize Redis in Node.js for basic caching and data management.
- Store and retrieve hash values from Redis.
- Handle asynchronous operations in Node.js with Redis.
- Implement and use Kue as a queue management system.
- Develop a basic Express application that interacts directly with Redis.
- Construct an Express application that integrates both Redis and Kue for enhanced data handling and job queuing.

## Installation

### Redis Server

Follow the Redis Quick Start guide to install and configure your local Redis server.

### Node.js and Project Dependencies

1. Install Node.js (version 12.x) following the official [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) guide.
2. Clone the repository and install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   npm install
   ```

## Required Files

Ensure your project includes the following files:

- **package.json**: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
